## All in one Build Script for OpenFOAM on MacOS X 
## ===============================================
##
## Intro
## -----
## 
## This is script is designed to make life easier, for building OpenFOAM
## on MacOS X. While many people are quite happy following a set of written
## instructions, there are others who just want things to work - it could be
## a question of laziness, but probably more that people want to focus on 
## what they are good at instead of learning something they feel they shouldn't
## need to.
##
## This script also makes it easier to eventually set up an automated build
## environment, though there may be some tweaks needed.
##
## Requirements
## ------------
##
##   - MacPorts
##   - XCode
##
## More Detail
## -----------
##
## This script does the following
##    - Creates & mounts the case-sensitive HFS+ Disk image
##    - Install the necessary ports from MacPorts
##    - Checks to see that necessary environment dependencies are in place
##    - Clones the Git project
##    - Builds the source code
